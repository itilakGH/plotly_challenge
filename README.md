# plotly_challenge
Samples studies and visualization with Java Script and Plotly
### Summary of the project:
In this project we worked with samples studies data and created an interactive web-page for visualization.
To be successful in this task we used 
- JavaScript to create events such as selecting drop down menu options, changing the details related to the selected option, filtering/sorting/mapping the data
- Plotly liblaries to create bar, gauge and bubble charts to reflect the samples data
- HTML to style the page
- GitHub to deploy the project and be able to share it
- a JSON file with research data of volunteers who participated in their bacteria species investigation


The goal of this project was to set all sample's IDs in the drop down menu options, display all demographic details of selected samples and create charts containing all sample's bacteria data.
